     When humans read web content, the information hierarchy is usually clear through visual style cues (e.g. large heading text).
     However, web content is not only read by humans with sight, and is sometimes not even read by humans (e.g. search engines).
     In order to make web content accessible to everyone, we need an alternative, non-visual way to add semantic structure.
     This is a problem that HTML solves.
